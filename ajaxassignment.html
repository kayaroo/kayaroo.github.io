<h1>Homework 8 - AJAX Application</h1>
<body>

<button type="button" onclick="loadDoc()">Get CD collection</button>

<table id="demo"></table>

<script>
function loadDoc() {
  const xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
  xhttp.onload = function() {
    myFunction(this);
  }
  xhttp.open("GET", "cd_catalog.xml");
  xhttp.send();
}
function myFunction(xml) {
  const xmlDoc = xml.responseXML;
  const x = xmlDoc.getElementsByTagName("CD");
  let table="<tr><th>Artist</th><th>Title</th></tr>";
  for (let i = 0; i <x.length; i++) { 
    table += "<tr><td>" +
    x[i].getElementsByTagName("ARTIST")[0].childNodes[0].nodeValue +
    "</td><td>" +
    x[i].getElementsByTagName("TITLE")[0].childNodes[0].nodeValue +
    "</td></tr>";
  }

<h2>Explanation of AJAX</h2>
<p>
Ajax stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. Ajax is a technique used for communicating with a server without the need to refresh. For example in this case, "
cd_catalog.xml" is used for sending all requests onto the file "ajaxassignment.html". You're able to code from the former while the ladder changes there without the need of having to refresh the webpage.

<h2>REST API</h2>
<p>The API that I chosen is Cat Facts API. What this does is that it it allows you to send text messages on random facts about cats daily. They include multiple features. For example, they include a timer which keeps track on the countdown on when the next set of cat facts appears. They even allow you to send your own facts that you know about cats as well. It uses response files like JSON, JS, YML, MD, gitignore, and bowerrc. It includes a Catbot that does multiple things like texting back when you text and adding recipients and allows you to view the conversation. It can even be able to import all the people you have in your google contacts in one go. </p>
